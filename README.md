# Ant-Random-Walk-in-R
Simple R code for a random walk of an ant towards a food source in an arena


An ant is released at the center of a square arena. The arena is divided into grids. The ant is at the center grid, and a food source is placed at the last grid (at a corner). The ant starts doing random walk, and reaches the food source - and we observe the whole process.
